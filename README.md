Here is a professional, high-quality `README.md` file designed for GitHub. It includes badges, a clear structure, installation instructions, feature highlights based on the code provided, and a project roadmap.

I have also included a **`requirements.txt`** block at the end, as you will need this for the repo to work.

# PythVinyl 🎵

**PythVinyl** is a hybrid desktop/web application that brings the tactile experience of vinyl crate digging to your digital music library.

It combines a **Python** backend (for robust file scanning, metadata extraction, and audio processing) with a high-fidelity **Three.js** frontend to create an immersive 3D music player. Browse your collection in crates, inspect gatefold covers, and drop the needle on a virtual turntable.

-----

## ✨ Features

### 🎧 The "Analog" Experience

  * **Crate Digging:** Browse your library as physical crates. Flip through records with realistic physics and lifting animations.
  * **Gatefold Inspection:** Click an album to pull it out. Watch the sleeve open up to reveal the disc and tracklist.
  * **Virtual Turntable:** A fully animated 3D turntable. Watch the tone arm move and the record spin.
  * **Needle Drop:** Click anywhere on the vinyl surface to seek to that timestamp, calculated by the groove position.

### 🛠️ Powerful Backend

  * **Library Scanner:** Recursively scans local directories for `.mp3` and `.flac` files.
  * **Smart Metadata:** Extracts ID3 tags, FLAC headers, and embedded artwork via `Mutagen`.
  * **Dynamic Theming:** Analyzes cover art to extract dominant colors, automatically theming the UI and 3D environment for each album.
  * **Audio Engine:** Low-latency playback using `Pygame` with cross-platform support.

### 💻 Modern Interface

  * **Hybrid Architecture:** A CustomTkinter desktop launcher controls a FastAPI WebSocket server.
  * **Websocket Sync:** Real-time bi-directional synchronization between the audio engine and the 3D visualizer.
  * **Gimbal Camera:** Custom-written camera controls allowing for smooth panning and zooming (Middle Mouse Button).

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites

  * Python 3.10 or higher
  * A modern web browser (Chrome/Firefox/Edge) with WebGL support.

### 1\. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PythVinyl.git
cd PythVinyl
```

### 2\. Install Dependencies

Create a virtual environment (recommended) and install the required packages.

```bash
# Windows
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# Linux/Mac
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3\. Run the Application

Start the desktop launcher.

```bash
python main.py
```

-----

## 🎮 Usage Guide

1.  **Launch:** Run `main.py`. A desktop window titled "Vinyl Stack Helper" will appear.
2.  **Scan:**
      * Click **"Select Music Directory"** and choose a folder containing your music.
      * Click **"Start New Scan"**. The backend will index your music and generate cover art caches.
3.  **Start Server:**
      * Once scanning is complete, click **"Start Server"**.
      * The status will change to "Server Running on Port 8000".
4.  **Visualize:**
      * Click **"Open in Browser"**.
      * **Left Click:** Select crates, pick albums, play tracks.
      * **Middle Mouse (Hold & Drag):** Rotate camera (Gimbal control).
      * **Scroll Wheel:** Move through crates or zoom in/out.
