**PythVinyl beta** is a hybrid desktop/web application that brings the tactile experience of vinyl crate digging to your digital music library.

It combines a **Python** backend (for robust file scanning, metadata extraction, and audio processing) with a high-fidelity **Three.js** frontend to create an immersive 3D music player. Browse your collection in crates, inspect gatefold covers, and drop the needle on a virtual turntable.
